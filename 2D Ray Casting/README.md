# 2D Ray Casting

The goal of this project is to recreate the demo introduced in [this challenge](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/145-2d-ray-casting.html) from [the coding train](https://thecodingtrain.com).

The topic is _ray casting_, whereby lines are projected from a point of reference against the surrounding environment. The lecturer implements a demo in the context of Processing, using the JavaScript language, but here I try to use two different stacks:

- JavaScript and the Canvas API

- Lua and Love2D
