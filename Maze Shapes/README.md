# Maze Shapes

Here you find a few projects connected to mazes. Consider it a spiritual successor to _Maze Algorithms_, the project folder where I explored different algorithms with _Lua_ and _Love2D_.

## Regular Grid

This demo introduces the shape already developed in the _Maze Algorithm_ folder. The grid is represented by a series of columns and rows, where each cell has up to four neighbors. The algorithms walks through the grid removing gates until every cell is visited.
