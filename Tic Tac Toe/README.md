# Tic Tac Toe

The goal of this project is two-fold:

- create a game of tic-tac-toe for two human players

- implement the _minimax algorithm_ to have the game occur between a human player and computer AI

The demo takes inspiration from [this challenge](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/149-tic-tac-toe.html) from [the coding train](https://thecodingtrain.com/), and uses the `<canvas>` element in conjunction with the [`Zdog`](https://zzz.dog) pseudo-3D engine.

## Tic Tac Zdog

The first experiment introduces a lot of concepts connected to the Zdog library, but allows to practice with several features of the JavaScript language as well. Consider the use of `for of` loops, or again `array.reduce` to spread the contents of a 2D array into a one-dimensional data structure, or again `string.match()` to extract the `hsl` components from the current color.
