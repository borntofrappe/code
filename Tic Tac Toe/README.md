# Tic Tac Toe

The goal of the project is to use the canvas element in conjunction with the `zdog` pseudo-3D engine, in order to recreate the game tic tac toe with a series of shapes.

The demo takes inspiration from [this challenge](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/149-tic-tac-toe.html) from [the coding train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) and is ultimately meant to be updated to have the player play against the computer, and have the computer follow the logic of an algorithm.
