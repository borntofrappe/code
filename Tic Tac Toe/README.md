# Tic Tac Toe

Here you find two projects:

- `Zdog`, a two-human-players tic tac toe board. The demo works as an introduction to the tic tac toe gameplay, and visualizes the choices through the pseudo-3D engine [Zdog](https://zzz.dog)

- `Minimax`, a tic tac toe board to play against a computer using the [_minimax algorithm_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)

The project folder takes inspiration from [a challenge](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/149-tic-tac-toe.html) from [the coding train](https://thecodingtrain.com/), specifically introducing the algorithm.
