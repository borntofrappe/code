# Traveling Salesperson

The project follows the progress made in the repository devoted to the nature of code, and specifically the demos devoted to genetic algorithms. The goal is to develop a solution to the traveling salesperson problem, in order to find the shortest path connecting a series of points.

The demo is in Lua and Love2D, and follows the lessons learned from [The Coding Train YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/BAejnwN4Ccw)
