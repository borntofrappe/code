# [Impossible Objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_object)

2D objects which are perceived as three dimensional, but have an intrinstic contradiction in their design.

The goal of this folder is to recreate a few of these objects with SVG syntax. I consider it good practice with the `d` attribute of the `<path>` element, as well as the `<clipPath>` element. This last one is essential to cut out portion of the shapes to create the illusion.

The first object is but an experiment with a shape created with two halves, two exact copy of the same visual.
